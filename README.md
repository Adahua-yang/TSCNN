# Two-Stage Convolutional Neural Network (TSCNN)

This is code for paper:  
`Person Re-identification Using Two-stage Convolutional Neural Network`


## Dependency Required

*   Python2.7+

>   tqdm  
>   pandas  
>   numpy  
>   matplotlib  
>   pytorch(cuda)


>   Note that we only ran the code in `Unbuntu16-x64`, but it should can be ran successfully in other Linux distribution systems such as `debian` and `centOS`.

## How to run

1. Download the dataset
2. Extract epicflow with our other project: [https://github.com/zyoohv/epicflow-python3.git](https://github.com/zyoohv/epicflow-python3.git)
3. edit the configure file `base_model/setting.json`
4. run `base_model/run.sh`
